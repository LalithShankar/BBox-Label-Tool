Most of these failures related to continuing \\n\\nsuspicious activity occurring in accounts held at Wells Fargo Advisors’ U.S. branch offices that \\n\\nfocused on international customers. \\n\\nTo help detect potential violations of the securities laws and other money laundering violations, \\n\\nthe Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) requires broker-dealers to file SARs to report suspicious \\n\\ntransactions that occur through their firms.  The BSA and the U.S. Treasury Department’s \\n\\nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) require the filing of a SAR within 30 days \\n\\nafter a broker-dealer determines the activity is suspicious.  For SARs identifying continuing \\n\\nactivity of a previously-filed SAR, FinCEN provides administrative relief which allows broker-\\n\\ndealers to file SARs for continuing activity within 120 days after the previously-related SAR \\n\\nfiling.   \\n\\nAccording to the SEC’s order, starting in approximately March 2012, new management over \\n\\nWells Fargo Advisors’ AML program created confusion by telling the firm’s SAR investigators \\n\\nthat they were filing too many SARs; that continuing activity SAR reviews were not a regulatory \\n\\nrequirement; that they were to take steps to eliminate further continuing activity reviews; and \\n\\nthat filing a SAR required “proof” of illegal activity.  These statements created an environment \\n\\nin which the SAR investigators experienced difficulty in recommending and filing SARs, \\n\\nespecially continuing activity SARs.  Ultimately, Wells Fargo Advisors’ total SAR filings \\n\\ndropped by approximately 60% during an 11-month period and the firm failed to file or timely \\n\\nfile at least 50 SARs, 45 of which related to continuing activity.    \\n\\nThe SEC’s order instituting a settled administrative and cease-and-desist proceeding finds that \\n\\nWells Fargo Advisors violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule \\n\\n17a-8.  Without admitting or denying the SEC’s findings, Wells Fargo Advisors consented to a \\n\\ncease-and-desist order, a censure, and a civil penalty of $3,500,000.  Wells Fargo Advisors also \\n\\nvoluntarily undertakes to review and update its policies and procedures and develop and conduct \\n\\nadditional training.  \\n\\nThe SEC’s investigation was conducted by Richard G. Stoltz, Paul Mensheha and Anne C. \\n\\nMcKinley of the Chicago Regional Office.  The examination that led to the investigation was \\n\\nconducted by Craig E. Carlson, Keith Frisz, David Hoffmeyer, George J. Jacobus, Paul \\n\\nMensheha and Jennifer L.

Most of these failures related to continuing \\nsuspicious activity occurring in accounts held at Wells Fargo Advisors’ U.S. branch offices that \\nfocused on international customers',\n",
              " 'To help detect potential violations of the securities laws and other money laundering violations, \\nthe Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) requires broker-dealers to file SARs to report suspicious \\ntransactions that occur through their firms.  The BSA and the U.S. Treasury Department’s \\nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) require the filing of a SAR within 30 days \\nafter a broker-dealer determines the activity is suspicious.  For SARs identifying continuing \\nactivity of a previously-filed SAR, FinCEN provides administrative relief which allows broker-\\ndealers to file SARs for continuing activity within 120 days after the previously-related SAR \\nfiling',\n",
              " 'According to the SEC’s order, starting in approximately March 2012, new management over \\nWells Fargo Advisors’ AML program created confusion by telling the firm’s SAR investigators \\nthat they were filing too many SARs; that continuing activity SAR reviews were not a regulatory \\nrequirement; that they were to take steps to eliminate further continuing activity reviews; and \\nthat filing a SAR required “proof” of illegal activity.  These statements created an environment \\nin which the SAR investigators experienced difficulty in recommending and filing SARs, \\nespecially continuing activity SARs.  Ultimately, Wells Fargo Advisors’ total SAR filings \\ndropped by approximately 60% during an 11-month period and the firm failed to file or timely \\nfile at least 50 SARs, 45 of which related to continuing activity',\n",
